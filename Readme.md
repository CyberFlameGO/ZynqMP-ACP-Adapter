ZynqMP ACP Adapter
==================

## Overview 

### Introduction

The PL masters can also snoop APU caches through the APUâ€™s accelerator coherency port(ACP).
The ACP accesses can be used to (read or write) allocate into L2 cache. However, the ACP only supports aligned 64-byte and 16-byte accesses. All other accesses get a SLVERR response.

## Features

ZynqMP-ACP-Adapter is an adapter to connect AXI Master to ZynqMP Accelerator Coherency Port(ACP).
The adapter then splits any burst-length transaction into several 64-byte or 16-byte transactions.

ZynqMP-ACP-Adapter is written in synthesizable VHDL.
